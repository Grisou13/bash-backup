Usage
====================================
Before using this script make sure that you have all the dependencies.

This script was entented to be portable but may not work on some distros, if so please fork me.

All backups created by this script are named as **backup-HOST-YYYY.m.d.HH.MM.SS** .

All backups that are **not** specified with --no-zip, will get bziped.

basic usage would be : `backup.sh -u username -p pwd -r mysite.com -d /var/www/html`, this would backup the remote directory recursivly and put it in the current working directory.
With a backup directory : `backup.sh -u username -p pwd -r mysite.com -d /var/www/html -b /var/backups/`, this would backup the remote directory recursivly with WGET, and put it in the specified directory.
With secure : `backup.sh -u username -p pwd -r mysite.com -d /var/www/html -b /var/backups/ --secure`, this would backup the remote directory recursivly with SCP, and put it in the specified directory.
